# Important note/caveats
I (the user) am currently quite sick. I have severe brain fog, memory problems, and reading difficulty. Please try to keep your sentences short and simple when chatting with me. This will also affect my ability to accurately instruct you. Please keep this in mind when deciding what code to write (that the instructions may be lacking due to user illness)

# AI Coding Assistant Instructions for Crib Backend
Activate the virtual environment with .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 before doing any work
- If you ever write any code that involves calculations, make sure to write a unit test to test that the calculation is correct
- When you are done completing any task, run the projects test suite to confirm that none of the existing functionality is broken
Once you have written the test, run the test iteratively and fix things until it passes

If you are coding in python, use log statements instead of print statements (logger = getLogger(__name__))
## Project Overview
FastAPI backend for a Cribbage game exposing a REST API. Core game logic lives in `cribbage/` (players, dealing, pegging, scoring). The API orchestrates rounds and exposes a clean, stable contract for the frontend.

## Architecture
- API: FastAPI app in `app.py`
- Game engine: `cribbage/` package (`CribbageGame`, `CribbageRound`, scoring functions)
- Session control: `GameSession`, `ResumableRound` in `app.py`
- Tests: Pytest under `test/`

## API Conventions
- Player names mapped for frontend:
  - Internal `"human"` → frontend `"you"`
  - Always use helper `_to_frontend_name()` and `_map_scores_for_frontend()`
- Response fields:
  - `scores`: keys `you`, `computer`
  - `dealer`: `you | computer | none`
  - `winner`: `you | computer | null`
  - `table_value`: reflects current active sequence only
- Don’t break these shape/keys; update tests if contracts expand.

## Key Helpers
- `_to_frontend_name(obj)`: maps internal player/strings to `"you"|"computer"`
- `_map_scores_for_frontend(game)`: returns `{ you, computer }`
- Use these for all future fields that include player names.

## Development Workflow
- Run tests: `python -m pytest -q`
- Local server: `python -m uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001`
- Keep changes minimal and focused; preserve existing public API shapes.

## Testing
- Prefer deterministic pegging tests; see `conftest.py` fixture `deterministic_computer`.
- Validate scoring events: pairs, fifteens, 31, runs; also `table_value` across sequences.
- When changing name mapping or response shapes, add invariant tests asserting keys and allowed values.

## Coding Conventions
- Type hints throughout `app.py`
- Clear, small helpers rather than inline ad-hoc mapping
- Avoid renaming API keys; map at boundary instead (internal → frontend)

## Notes
- Sequence boundaries reset only at `go_or_31_reached()`
- Keep logs helpful but not noisy; `debug()` shows pegging steps
