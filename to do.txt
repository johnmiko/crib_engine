test_medium_player
    need to delete the tests that I'm not using anymore 
medium_player_discard_strat
    hand_stats = query "hand_stats" table, check if values are already calculated
    for missing_data in hand_stats:
        row = process_dealt_hand()
        update_table
    discards = hand_stats +/- crib values


Need to check that test_medium_player passes
    hand_scores table is not correct, well cards in hand 3H|4H|5H|6H
    but in the scores table AS|3H|4H|5H|6H = 8 because starter is 6H
    So the hand_scores is not wrong, but maybe doesn't include everything, I dunno
    I look up hand_stats_approx hand_key="3H|4H|5H|6H" which has the wrong min score

after 1 game, average pegging 3.4, average hand 7.1

def test_get_6_card_stats_df_is_correct():
    # manually checked calculations using a crib app
    hand = build_hand(["3h","4h","5h","6h","7h","8h"])
    # the minimum is 12, but my db shows 10, it's because 3,4,5,6 and 5,6,7,8 is the case where any starter gives another 2 points
    df = get_6_card_stats_df(hand, dealer_is_self=True)
    df2 = pd.DataFrame({"hi":[18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28],})
    assert df.equals(df2)
